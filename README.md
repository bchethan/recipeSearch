Description: Allow users to search for recipes based on ingredients or keywords, 
fetching data from a recipe API.
Focus: API integration, handling search queries, displaying results, and potentially 
adding a "view details" for each recipe.
Hint: Look for public recipe APIs (e.g., TheMealDB, Spoonacular API).
